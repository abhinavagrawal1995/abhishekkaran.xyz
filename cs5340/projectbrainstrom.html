<p>Project 1:</p>
<p>
    <h3>Places of Worship Virtual Tours:</h3>
</p>
    <p>

    This project takes inspiration from the virtual tours available for colleges.
    (https://www.youvisit.com/northeastern, https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/visit/virtual-tour). There are these
    Google street view available for roaming around the world. But, they don’t give enough information about the
    sightseeing’s and the architecture around us, let alone for important architectural monuments.

<p><img src="../cs5340/images/img2.PNG"></img>Figure 2: Centennial Hall View</p>
<p>So, I propose to create a virtual tour guild intended specifically for the worship places around the globe which are
famous(Barcelona Cathedral: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Cathedral">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Cathedral</a>)
and may be not
accessible(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashupatinath_Temple">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashupatinath_Temple</a>)
throughout the year. For ease of tourists and
    worshippers, this can be a great tool to leverage. This will not only be helpful for the first timers who want to
    view such places but can also give a natural and more organic experience of these destination. I am planning to add
    more information of the surrounding building and places regarding such places.
    Just like the images above has a virtual image for the places in and around the Northeastern Campus, I am planning
    something similar for the shrines and churches around the globe with a much more engrossing experience through the
    use of facts and information popups.

<p>Technological Angle:</p>
    <p>
Using Google Street View APIs (<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro</a>),
Three.js
(<a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a>), Node.js, JavaScript/ JQuery are good
places to start
exploring.

<p>Project 2:</p>
<p>
    <h3>Interactive 5th Grade Science Projects:</h3>
</p>
<p>This project is about using the common science experiments like the egg drop project
(<a href="https://buggyandbuddy.com/stem-kids-egg-drop-project/">https://buggyandbuddy.com/stem-kids-egg-drop-project/</a>)
and transform to the virtual world. Create
panoramic images and simulation of these experiments to enhance the learning experience. Current application on web look like this
(<a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Egg-Drop/Egg-Drop-Interactive">https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Egg-Drop/Egg-Drop-Interactive</a>)
which tend to convey the core logic but is very bland and boring. Enhancing such experiences and helping kids learn
better is the aim of this project.</p>

<p>
    Technical Angle:</p>
<p>Using Three.js(<a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a>), Knowledge of basic sciences, List of
projects can be taken from (<a href="https://www.education.com/science-fair/fifth-grade/">https://www.education.com/science-fair/fifth-grade/</a>).
Web application with express.js(<a href="https://expressjs.com/">https://expressjs.com/</a>) for
    server side coding will be helpful to store all the related data regarding the experiments.

<p>Project 3:</p>
<p>
    <h3>Codetrip:</h3>
</p>
<p>
Ever wondered why we filled up all those text boxes and drop downs and calendars to plan a trip? It’s very irritating
and cumbersome to use them like figure 4. So, I am proposing a new Visual way to plan a road trip. With very few(or no)
textboxes and other form elements. Through use of maps directly putting the source and destination on to it. Getting
major restroom stops and customizable city detours along the way. Something like figure 5 will give a general knowhow
of the project. A customizable itinerary for the same will be generated which will have all the important details like
restroom stops, gas stations, scenic views along the route etc.

<p>Technical Angle: Google Location APIs(<a href="https://developers.google.com/location-context/">https://developers.google.com/location-context/</a>),
    Node.js, Materialize front end(<a href="https://materializecss.com/">https://materializecss.com/</a>) for a basic web application. </p>
